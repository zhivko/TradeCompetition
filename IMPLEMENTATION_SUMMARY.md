# Trading System Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

### 1. Root Element Structure
- Root element is `<trading>` as requested
- `<state_of_market>` section at the top level
- `<agent>` section for active/closed trades and summary

### 2. Comprehensive Market Data 
All 5 coins (BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, DOGE) include:
- Real price data from Binance API
- Real open interest data from Binance Futures API  
- Real funding rates from both USDT and USD futures endpoints
- Properly calculated EMA20, MACD, and RSI from price data
- Individual XML elements for each data point (not JSON)

### 3. Data Limitations
- **Series data limited to last 10 values** as requested:
  - `intraday_prices` (10 values)
  - `ema_20_series` (10 values) 
  - `macd_series` (10 values)
  - `rsi_7_series` (10 values)
  - `rsi_14_series` (10 values)
  - `long_macd_series` (10 values)
  - `long_rsi_14_series` (10 values)
- **Lookback period preserved for calculations** - Still use 50+ data points for proper indicator calculations, but only store last 10 in XML

### 4. Technical Indicators
- Custom calculation functions for EMA, MACD, RSI, ATR
- No external dependencies (no TA-Lib) for portability
- Proper mathematical formulas for accurate calculations

### 5. System Architecture
- Modular design with separate MarketCoordinator and TradingAgent classes
- Shared XML manager for consistent file structure
- Asynchronous operations for efficient API calls
- Virtual environment with requirements.txt for dependency management

### 6. Data Persistence
- XML structure with individual elements for each data point
- Series data stored as child `<value>` elements
- Timestamps for all data points
- Proper separation of state_of_market and agent sections

### 7. Logging and Debugging
- Full prompts and API responses saved to user_prompt.txt
- Clear error handling and fallback values
- Comprehensive logging throughout the system

## Key Files

1. `market_coordinator.py` - Fetches and processes market data from Binance
2. `trading_agent.py` - Processes market data and makes trading decisions  
3. `xml_manager.py` - Shared XML management utilities
4. `requirements.txt` - Dependencies for virtual environment
5. `trade.xml` - Persistent storage of market state and trade data
6. `user_prompt.txt` - Log of prompts sent to DeepSeek API

## Dependencies

- aiohttp - Async HTTP client for API calls
- python-dotenv - Environment variable management
- numpy - Numerical computing for array operations

## Usage

1. Set up virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate environment: `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add DeepSeek API key to `.env` file
5. Run system: `python main.py`

The system will automatically fetch market data from Binance every minute, calculate technical indicators, and save all data to the XML structure.
