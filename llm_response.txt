  "action": "hold",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "reason": "No strong buy or sell signals from RSI and MACD indicators for any symbol. RSI values are not in extreme zones (e.g., BTC RSI 33.37, not below 30; BNB RSI 69.72, not above 70), and MACD shows no confirmed crossovers. Risk rules not triggered as no trade is warranted."
